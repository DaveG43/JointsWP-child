## To install:
1. Install JointsWp theme in the appropriate directory
1. Install JointsWp-child in the appropriate directory
1. (optional) install [nodejs](http://nodejs.org/) and [grunt](http://gruntjs.com/).


The gruntfile is pre-set up to work with zurb foundation, [bourbon](http://bourbon.io/), [libsass](https://github.com/hcatlin/libsass), and live-reload.
If you use grunt watch, and live reload, you can build your sass files (using the super fast libsass)
and live preview your work as you go.
